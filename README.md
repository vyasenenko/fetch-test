# Fetch

- **DataBinding**: Simplifies UI development by allowing binding of UI components in layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel pattern for separation of concerns and maintainable code.
- **LiveData**: Observes data changes and updates the UI accordingly, ensuring the UI is always in sync with the data.
